# Startup_Model_Excel
This financial modeling project involved creating a comprehensive financial model for a gym startup, incorporating forecasts from web sources and market-based estimates. The model includes detailed financial statements—Cash Flow Statement, Income Statement, and Balance Sheet—to assess the business's profitability and sustainability.

In addition to core financial statements, the model features:

Valuation Analysis to estimate the business’s worth.
Loan Repayment Schedule to track debt obligations and interest payments.
Depreciation Schedule for asset management and tax calculations.
A Control Sheet acts as the central hub, allowing adjustments to key assumptions, including inflation rates, growth rates, and market prices, ensuring flexibility and accuracy in financial projections. This model serves as a decision-making tool, enabling scenario analysis and strategic planning for potential investors and stakeholders.
